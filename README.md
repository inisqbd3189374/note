- "Every programmer should know that code is read much more often than it is written. Therefore, the goal of every programmer should be to write code that is easy to read and understand, not just code that works." - Martin Fowler

In other words, focus on writing clean, well-structured, and well-documented code that can be easily understood by others (including your future self). This will not only make your code more maintainable and scalable, but also improve collaboration and productivity within your team.
